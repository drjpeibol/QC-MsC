# Quantum Notation Activity

## Objectives

Through this activity, you will acquire the necessary skills to work with quantum states and their evolution using circle notation.

## Guidelines

The following exercise is proposed:

### Exercise

Using Python and a Jupyter notebook in IBM Quantum Lab, implement a function that visually represents the state of the quantum register using circle notation. The function should receive as input the state vector of the quantum register and return a figure with the representation of the state.
